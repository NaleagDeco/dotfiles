I am indebted to https://github.com/peel/dotfiles for providing a guiding light on how to set up a unified Nix repo that will work on MacOS and NixOS and conform in some way to the Nix User Repository model

The following directories are deprecated and files in them should be moved elsewhere:

- zsh/ :: into a custom package or overlay
- nix/ :: into the standard nur layout, or the machines nixops-like folder.
- src/ :: into a custom package or overlay for the respective package involved

Things that need to be installed manually still
- (OSX) Yubico Authenticator :: don't know how to use nix for .pkg files
- (OSX) Yubikey Manager :: don't know how to use nix for .pkg files
